# Linear-Regression-from-scratch

## Objective
The purpose of this repository is to implement linear regression from scratch in Pytorch.
We will see how this method works on real-world data.

## Blog Post
The blog post explaining the work of this repository can be found [here](https://consciousml.github.io/blog/linear-regression/insurance-data/pytorch/from-scratch/2020/09/12/Linear-Regression.html).

## Dataset
The dataset used for this experiment can be found in the `data` folder.
The Swedich Auto Insurance dataset contains:
- X: The number of claims by customer.
- Y: The total payment the customer got by the insurance.

## Setup
In order to install the conda environment needed to run the notebook, run the following line:
```console
conda env create --file requirements.yml
conda activate torch
```
